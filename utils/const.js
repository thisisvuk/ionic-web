I-Dose avoids underdosing or overdosing by monitoring and controlling chemical addition with accuracy, ultimately optimizing the chemical treatment process. The system uses KPIs such as LSI (Langelier Saturation Index), RSI (Ryznar Saturation Index), and performance indicators like differential pressure across heat exchangers and cooling towers to evaluate system performance and ensure efficiency.",
